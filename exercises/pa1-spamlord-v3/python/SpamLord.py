This function takes in a filename along with the file object (actually
a StringIO object at submission time) and
scans its contents against regex patterns. It returns a list of
(filename, type, value) tuples where type is either an 'e' or a 'p'
for e-mail or phone, and value is the formatted phone number or e-mail.
The canonical formats are:
     (name, 'p', '###-###-#####')
     (name, 'e', 'someone@something')
If the numbers you submit are formatted differently they will not
match the gold answers

NOTE: ***don't change this interface***, as it will be called directly by
the submit script

NOTE: You shouldn't need to worry about this, but just so you know, the
'f' parameter below will be of type StringIO at submission time. So, make
sure you check the StringIO interface if you do anything really tricky,
though StringIO should support most everything.
